# Hello World!
#
# This is going to be very easy instructions, just to get us started.
#
# The instructions here are simple.
# - Start a line of code below
# - Type the word 'print'
# - After print, type an opening bracket - this one '('
# - After the opening bracket, type a '"'
# - Now type 'Hello World!' after the '"'
# - After that, close the '"'
# - Now, finally a closing bracket.
# - Save the program
# - run it at the command line with $ python hello.py - note, this is also the first move in testing your code.
# - If it doesn't work, first try to see if you can figure out where you need to fix something.
# - When it works, add it to git and update your git repo.  Your git commit might say "completed Hello World program"
